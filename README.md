# Expense Tracker

This project is a simple **expense tracking system** implemented in Python. It allows users to add, update, remove, and retrieve expenses**, with built-in validation  via a JSON file. 

# Features

- ✅ **Expense Creation** – Each expense gets a **unique ID**, title, amount, and timestamps for when it was created/updated.
- ✅ **Validation** – Prevents negative values for expenses.
- ✅ **Updating Expenses** – Modify the title or amount while keeping timestamps accurate.
- ✅ **Expense Lookup** – Search for expenses by **ID or title**.
- ✅ **Expense Deletion** – Remove expenses by ID, with a confirmation check.
- ✅ **Data Persistence** – Save and load expenses automatically using **JSON storage** (optional).
- ✅ **Unique Titles (Optional)** – Prevent duplicate expense names if needed.
